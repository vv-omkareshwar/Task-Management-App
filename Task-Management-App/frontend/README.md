# Task Management App - Frontend

## Overview

Task Management App is a modern, responsive web application built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript. It provides an intuitive interface for managing tasks using a Kanban board style layout, allowing users to efficiently organize and track their work.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (latest stable version)
- npm or yarn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Task-Management-App.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd Task-Management-App/frontend
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env.local` file in the frontend directory and add the following:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000 # Adjust this to your backend API URL
   ```

## Running the Application

To start the development server:

```
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

- `components/`: Reusable React components.
- `store/`: Redux store configuration and providers.
- `styles/`: CSS modules and global styles.
- `types/`: TypeScript type definitions.

## Key Components

- **KanbanBoard**: Main component for displaying and managing tasks in a Kanban-style board.
- **TaskCard**: Represents individual tasks within the Kanban board.
- **TaskModal**: Modal for creating and editing tasks.
- **Sidebar**: Navigation component for the application.
- **Toolbar**: Contains actions for task management and filtering.

## API Integration

The frontend interacts with a backend API for data persistence and user authentication. API calls are made using fetch or axios (depending on the implementation) to endpoints defined in the backend.

Ensure that the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in your `.env.local` file points to the correct backend API URL.

```
npm test
# or
yarn test
```

(Note: Adjust this section based on the actual testing setup in the project)
