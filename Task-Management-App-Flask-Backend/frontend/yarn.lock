# yarn.lock

# This file is generated automatically by Yarn and should not be manually edited.
# It is used to lock the versions of package dependencies.
# To update this file, run `yarn install` or `yarn add <package>`.

# Instructions for managing yarn.lock:

# 1. Initial creation:
#    - Ensure you have a package.json file in your project.
#    - Run `yarn install` to generate the yarn.lock file.

# 2. Adding new dependencies:
#    - Use `yarn add <package>` to add new dependencies.
#    - This will automatically update the yarn.lock file.

# 3. Updating dependencies:
#    - Use `yarn upgrade` to update all dependencies to their latest versions.
#    - Use `yarn upgrade <package>` to update a specific package.

# 4. Resolving conflicts:
#    - If you encounter merge conflicts in yarn.lock, do not edit the file manually.
#    - Instead, resolve conflicts in package.json and run `yarn install` to regenerate yarn.lock.

# 5. Version control:
#    - Always commit yarn.lock to your version control system along with package.json.

# 6. CI/CD:
#    - Ensure your CI/CD pipeline uses `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` to respect the locked versions.

# Best practices:
# - Never edit this file manually.
# - Always use Yarn commands to manage dependencies.
# - Keep this file in version control to ensure consistent builds across all environments.
# - Regularly update dependencies to get the latest features and security patches.

# Note: The actual content of this file will be a list of all installed packages,
